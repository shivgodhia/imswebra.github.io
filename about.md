## More About Me
I am a student in Edmonton, Canada. Since I was about 10 years old I have had an ever-growing interest in design that started with digital art, mostly due to my inability to draw and the computer's ability to undo. This initial interest has since lead me to explore a wide range of topics, generally enabled by my computer and the internet, and for those around me to develop a vast misconception of my talents and abilities. We all know that if you completed 2/9 javascript courses on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) to appease a teacher in grade six it should "just be easy" (Nick, 11:57am, Recess) to quickly change someone's French grades from my 2012 iPod Touch. Apparently writing over their paper report card with sharpie doesn't count. Since this *sixth grade escapade,* (which also happens to be the name of my new band), I have dabbled in photo manipulation, app design, 3D modeling, game design, listening to people complain about their various technology-related problems, VFX, python programming, logo design, trying to fix people's various technology-related problems once I determine that they have a reasonable balance in "*seems like a human I might want to associate with eventually*" and "*much too annoying to listen to their complaining any longer*," video production, video editing, run on sentences, all the other the interests I never was good at but currently forget, and now, website development. Not in any particular order of course.

I never got very far with any of these. They aren't things I can do, more just things I poked with a stick to see how they would jiggle. Emphasis was most definitely placed on "dabbled." To see the work I'm actually capable of, see the [projects page.](/projects/)

## More *More* About Me, As Per My Loving Friends.
I asked my friends to describe me in under four words. More specifically, the message said, "Describe me in under 4 words. Go. This is serious." Their responses included such literary masterpieces as:

* Where are your manners?
* robot computer man
* no.
* not the worst human
* The boy who never gives anyone any information about anything he's ever doing and makes you suffer internally until months later he finally decides you're worthy to know the "secret" which ends up being just a [big bubble](https://youtu.be/3TwVFOzrwzI) and you realize your suffering was for nothing but he still is smug af and full of himself about it.

## The Name
im路swe路bra  
Pronounced as: [contraction for "I am"]路[first syllable of Sweden]路[women's undergarment]

Its origin in fact has nothing to do with believing one is a Swedish-breast-support system, but rather a short story from my childhood. My youngest sister could not pronounce her Z's, and therefore often needed help doing up her "swipper," or would ask why rabbits run in "swig-swags." When we first went to the zoo, we were rather surprised to see a "swebra," marking the birth of the name I would later adopt.
