This was another daily; made for the sake of making. I vaguely remember this being another artist emulation, but I cannot remember of who's.

The simplistic text shapes were originally done in Illustrator, just for the simplicity of working with vectors. The (ugly and awful) circles were also done in Illustrator simply because I find Illustrators navigation / creation process easier for simple shapes. The letters mask a slightly tuned abstract watercolor image of which I can’t remember and probably stole. The background is just a stock image (which, again, I can’t find) with a gradient overlay applied.
