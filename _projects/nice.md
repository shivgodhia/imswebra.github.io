  This was a simple project vectorizing a doodle made in class.

The text was made with Illustrator's pen tool, following a basic, predetermined grid. Stoke width was then determined, and caps and corners were set to rounded.

The background is a [public domain photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/saltonline/14663175778/) of the METU Faculty of Architecture, found in the [Old New Stock](http://nos.twnsnd.co/) Tumblr collection. It was applied a simple gradient map, and then the text was then pasted over top. Though subtle, the text appears slightly translucent with the original photo's color showing through (no gradient map applied). This was actually achieved by having a copy of the unmodified background layer being masked by the text. What you are seeing is said layer with its opacity turned way down above the fully opaque text layer.
