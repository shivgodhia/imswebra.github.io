Following the tutorial, you can see that the abstract qualities were completely done in Blender, using the program's tools to randomly change the height and the color of the towers. The model was lit by a HDR image (of which I no longer have), and rendered with the Cycle's engine. The final product is simply the raw render with some Photoshop cropping. There was no additional post-processing done.
